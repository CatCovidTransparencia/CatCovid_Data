The final file is:  
`EU-Reg_deaths-hosp_series.csv`

It contains the **deaths-series (in hospital)** for the European countries and regions we used in our comparative. All the values come from official sources.  
We get the regional datas for:  
Spain, France, Italy, Belgium, Germany, UK.  
We mainly use, Madrid (ES-MD), Lombardia (IT-LOM).

**The spanish regional datas are one day earlier than the official Gobierno dates. It's because they give the numbers at midday, the day after the 21h recount closing.**  
**It' important for us to adjust to the real date, given that we are analising precise time events.**


There's a file with the Total deaths number given by country, the number you see in the news. The numbers are the same for Spain, Italy and Germany, because they don't give total deaths numbers.  
Each country use a diferent methodology. They don't give regional recount of total deaths:  
`EU_deaths-All_series.csv`
